# Prod Tools

## Motivation

As I progress with my work, I discovered that I have been writing some scripts over and over. This
is a waste of time, and also not smart. I decide to organize these scripts & functions that I use
repeatedly with this repo.

scripts may contain
  - hdfs tools
  - some itertools that python doesn't ship by default
  - others

Noted that this repo cannot contain anything related to business secrets.
